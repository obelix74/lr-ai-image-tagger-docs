# Security Analysis Report: Lightroom Gemini AI Image Tagger

**Date**: 2025-07-16  
**Scope**: Source code security analysis of `/src` directory  
**Assessment**: **SECURE FOR INTENDED USE**

## Executive Summary

The Lightroom Gemini AI Image Tagger plugin demonstrates good security practices for its intended use case. The codebase properly handles API key storage, uses secure communication protocols, and implements appropriate input validation. The main privacy consideration is the inherent nature of the service - photos are sent to Google's AI service for analysis, which is clearly disclosed and controllable by users.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. API Key Security ✅ **SECURE**

**Secure Storage Implementation**
- Uses Lightroom's `LrPasswords` API with salt-based encryption (`GeminiAPI.lua:153-158`)
- Salt is randomly generated and stored separately from the API key
- Proper key clearing function removes both salt and stored key (`GeminiAPI.lua:161-165`)

**No Hardcoded Credentials**
- No API keys, passwords, or secrets found in source code
- All sensitive data properly externalized to secure storage

### 2. HTTP Communication Security ✅ **SECURE**

**HTTPS-Only Communication**
- All API calls use HTTPS to `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta` (`GeminiAPI.lua:37`)
- No HTTP endpoints or insecure communication channels

**Proper Request Headers**
- Uses appropriate JSON content-type and accept headers (`GeminiAPI.lua:214-215`)
- Follows HTTP best practices for API communication

**Rate Limiting**
- Implements configurable delays between requests (`GeminiAPI.lua:426, 447-450`)
- Prevents abuse and respects API rate limits
- Limited to 2 retries to prevent excessive API calls (`GeminiAPI.lua:39`)

**SSL/TLS Security**
- Relies on Lightroom's `LrHttp` which uses system SSL/TLS implementation
- Benefits from OS-level certificate validation

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅ **ADEQUATE**

**JSON Data Handling**
- Uses proper JSON encoding for API requests (`GeminiAPI.lua:319`)
- Structured JSON parsing with error handling (`GeminiAPI.lua:349`)

**Data Encoding**
- Image data properly encoded with `LrStringUtils.encodeBase64` (`GeminiAPI.lua:319`)
- Base64 encoding prevents binary data issues

**Output Sanitization**
- Proper quote escaping for CSV export (`AiTaggerMenuItem.lua:528-544`)
- String sanitization with `LrStringUtils.trimWhitespace` (`GeminiAPI.lua:481`)

### 4. Error Handling ✅ **SECURE**

**No Information Disclosure**
- Error messages don't expose API keys or sensitive internal data
- Structured error responses without revealing system internals (`GeminiAPI.lua:338-410`)

**Graceful Degradation**
- Failed requests return safe, user-friendly error messages
- Proper error propagation without exposing sensitive details

**Logging Security**
- Uses structured logging without exposing credentials (`Logger.lua:16`)
- Log output controlled and doesn't leak sensitive information

### 5. Data Privacy ⚠️ **REVIEW REQUIRED**

**Third-Party Data Sharing**
- Photos are uploaded to Google's Gemini AI service for analysis
- This is the intended functionality but has privacy implications

**Metadata Sharing**
- Optional GPS/EXIF data sharing with AI service (`GeminiAPI.lua:223-306`)
- Users can disable GPS/EXIF sharing in preferences
- Clear logging of what metadata is being shared

**User Control**
- Users have control over metadata sharing preferences
- No unexpected data collection or sharing

### 6. File System Security ✅ **ACCEPTABLE**

**Temporary File Handling**
- Temporary files created with system defaults (`GeminiAPI.lua:129-138`)
- Files cleaned up appropriately
- No sensitive data persisted to temporary files

**Access Control**
- Uses writeAccessDo with 5-second timeout (`AiTaggerMenuItem.lua:498`)
- Proper resource management and cleanup

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Privacy Documentation**: Ensure users understand that photos are sent to Google's AI service
2. **Data Retention**: Clarify Google's data retention policies for uploaded images

### Medium Priority
1. **Certificate Pinning**: Consider implementing certificate pinning for API endpoints
2. **Request Signing**: Implement request signing if supported by Gemini API

### Low Priority
1. **Temporary File Permissions**: Use more restrictive permissions for temporary files
2. **Additional Input Validation**: Add more comprehensive input validation for user preferences

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Users should be informed about data processing by Google
- **Privacy Laws**: Ensure compliance with local privacy regulations
- **Terms of Service**: Review Google's terms for commercial use of Gemini API

## Conclusion

The Lightroom Gemini AI Image Tagger plugin implements appropriate security measures for its intended use case. The code follows security best practices for API key storage, secure communication, and input validation. The primary consideration is the inherent privacy implications of sending photos to a third-party AI service, which is clearly the intended functionality and should be properly disclosed to users.

**Overall Security Rating**: SECURE FOR INTENDED USE
